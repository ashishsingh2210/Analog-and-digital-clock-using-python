## What is deep learning?

Deep learning is like super-smart computer brains inspired by how our own brains work. It's a part of computer learning where we teach computer systems to figure things out by showing them lots and lots of examples. These systems, called neural networks, become experts at recognizing patterns and solving tricky problems. We use them for cool stuff like making computers see and understand pictures, talk and understand language, and even help robots make decisions on their own. Deep learning is like giving computers superpowers to learn and be smart without us telling them every little thing. It's super exciting!

**Deep learning according to some famous authors**
* **Geoffrey Hinton:**
   > A pioneering figure in deep learning, Hinton often describes deep learning as a machine learning technique inspired by the human brain, where artificial neural networks learn from data to perform tasks without explicit programming

* **Yann LeCun:**
   > LeCun, a key contributor to the development of convolutional neural networks, may define deep learning as a set of algorithms that allow machines to learn and make decisions by mimicking the way the human brain processes information.

* **Ian Goodfellow:**
   > Co-author of the influential deep learning textbook, Goodfellow might describe deep learning as a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training neural networks with multiple layers to automatically extract features and make predictions.

* **Andrew Ng:**
   > A prominent figure in machine learning education, Ng might define deep learning as a method where computers learn to perform tasks by being fed large amounts of data, enabling them to discover complex patterns and relationships.

* **Fei-Fei Li:**
   > As a leading figure in computer vision, Li might emphasize deep learning's role in enabling machines to understand visual data by learning hierarchical representations from examples.

* **Juergen Schmidhuber:**
   > A key contributor to the development of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, Schmidhuber might describe deep learning as a way to train neural networks with many layers, allowing them to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in data.
