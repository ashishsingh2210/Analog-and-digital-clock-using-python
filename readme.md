# DEEP LEARNING WITH MATHEMATICS ROAD MAP

![deep learning](https://i1.wp.com/ucanalytics.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Maths-of-Deep-Learning-Neural-Networks-Image-3.jpg?fit=1200%2C686)

While doing programming and making neural networks using programming language the main problem that most of us face is that, how to select number of hidden layers, number of neurons, which activation function is best and others.
While doing programming on different neural network, once a while we all think how machine understands from these data and gives best result from it.

Like me if you all have faced these problems then this roadmap is for you in which we will be covering all the topics that you need to learn for building a neural network on your own. This roadmap will maily focus on reality of deep neural networks with the help of maths and along with that there are differnce to code (in python) to pratice. 

* This course will cover all essential topics (you can read in below in content section) which will help you in:- 
	- Becoming a good programmer
 	- Help in doing research in deep learning
  	- Help in applying for job in deep learning
   	- Becoming a teacher for deep learning

* **[INTRODUCTION]()**
	- What is deep learning
	- Historical advancement in deep learning
	- Current state -of-art techniques in deep learning
	- Limitation in current techniques and idea for future research

This section will give a idea about the deep learning, how it evolved over time, which techniques are used in industries and limitation. The main idea of learning above topics is because as a human we are curious of how this happend in first place which helps us to understant present and motivate us to generate/make new things future.

* **[MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION FOR DEEP LEARNING]()**
	- Linear Algebra
	- Calculus
	- Probability
	- Statistics
	- Information theory

The base of the building will tell that how much that will building can withstand and what are the its limitations. Just like that, this section will provide a mathematical base for the learning the essential terms used for the deep learning. The terms used in section will we help you throughout the couses. These topic are not just from deep learning, it will also help in understanding machine learning concepts too.

* **[ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS FOR DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS]()**
 	- Connections
  	- Weights
  	- Bias
   	- Propogation function and network input
   	- Activation Function
   	- Regularization
   	- Output Function
   	- Learning Strategy
   	- FeedForward Algorithm
   	- Gradient Descent Algorithm
   	- BackPropogation Algorithm

Here, we will implement the above mathematics basic for building the key terms used in creating a network. These are basic concepts that plays a vital role in creating a deep neural networks. Adjusting the above topics in different manner helps to create different deep neural network and also how well these deep neural network perform.

* **[SUPERVISED DEEP LEARNING]()**
   	- Artificial Neural Network
   	- Perceptron Learning
   	- Multilayer Neural Network
   	- Recurrent Neural Network
   	- Convolution Neural Network
   	- Generative Adversarial Network

The supervised deep learning is same supervised learning for machine learning. While handling the large dataset where machine learning does not perform well these technqiues works as a ease. Apart from all the above technique the GAN is used for both supervised and unsupervised deep learning.  

* **[UNSUPERVISED DEEP LEARNING]()**
   	- Linear factor model
   	- Autoencoders
   	- Representation Learning
   	- Structured Probability Model for Deep Learning
   	- Monte Carlo Method
   	- Deep Generative Model

The unsupervised deep learning is like unsupervised machine learning .it handles high di-mensionality of the random variables that are hard to model using machine learning
